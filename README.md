## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the type of data structure or algorithm, all implemented in C++.

```
├── Sorting
│   ├── BubbleSort.cpp
│   ├── QuickSort.cpp
│   └── ...
├── Searching
│   ├── BinarySearch.cpp
│   ├── LinearSearch.cpp
│   └── ...
├── Trees
│   ├── BinarySearchTree.cpp

│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guptaashish2003/DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHIMS.git
```

Navigate to the desired folder and explore the C++ implementations. Each folder includes a README.md file with information about the data structure or algorithm, along with usage examples.
